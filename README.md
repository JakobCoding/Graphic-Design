**Common Terms in Graphic Design**

- Kerning: The Space between letters and characters
- Leading: The space between paragraphs or sentences

**Different Type Styles:**

1. Serif: serifs have tails, serifs help when there’s a large amount of text but smaller, the serifs help the reader distinguish the letters much easier
2. Sans-Serif: Make solid clean headlines and help them to stand out
3. script fonts: The help add a more natural look, they can easily overwhelm a design piece if you use too many
4. font mixing: is a great way to enhance a design
5. <b>Font weight:</b> Thin, light, medium, <b>bold</b>, <b>HEAVY</b>
   1. Railway is a great font with many different weight options
   2. Helvetica has a wide variety of weights, Helvetica is used a lot in design
   3. Gill Sans is another great example
6. Using two different weights in the same font family pair very well together in designs and provide a balance to your typography
7. Spacing:
   1. Can make all the difference in a design and really make a design stand out, but too much space can be a problem especially for lowercase letters, they don’t handle dramatic spacing well.
   2. The opposite is true for Uppercase letters, They remain strong and easy to read, it works wonders for ALL CAPS.
   3. Do not use wide spacing with script fonts
8. _Italics:_ When there is a lot of text in a particular space, italics help to _highlight_ a _keyword_ or phrase.
9. ALL CAPS vs lowercase: balance is key, find ways to mix up your typography usage by using a wonderful combination serif and sans serif fonts together using a mix of capitol and lower case, this ensures your design is unique and diverse.

**Type Styles:** A Detailed Overview - Serifs

- its good practice to have a special list of 20 - 30 of your favorite fonts that you can use on projects.

**Serifs:** There a lot of good choices

- Times new Roman is the default serif font

**How to know when to use which font in a particular project?**

**Old Style fonts:** Easy to read used in the past for book printing

- Garamond , Berkely, Minion, Palatino

**Transitional Fonts:** In between old style & modern fonts

- Bodoni - (canvas default font selection) Highly stylized and commonly used in high end fashion brands
- Didot - A lot of major brands use didot as their typeface of choice - such as vogue and CBS

**Consider picking a modern serif or Didone font** when working with high end clients.

- The thin lines add an elegance that’s hard to achieve with an old style font
- There is high contrast between the thickness and thinness of the lines, you can put more dramatic spacing between characters, to create a dramatic effect.
- They can also be good for dramatic poster headlines with simple solid backgrounds.

**Slab Serifs:**

- Originally designed to demand peoples attention, thick bold lines with almost zero contrast. **Chunky thick and bold, they certainly grabbed our attention throughout the years.**
- They used slab serifs on **Wanted Posters** back in the old west to make sure you **took notice!**
- Designers use slab serifs for the same reason. A great way to grab someone’s attention, Political statements for example
- **Rockwell , Archer & Archer Pro** and good options and are commonly used in design projects.
